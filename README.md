# permission-whitelist-paper
Uses permissions to allow/deny login to paper servers.

This is a project that was made quickly at 2am to allow me to control the whitelist of paper servers using permissions in luckperms.
It has a few extra features to prevent lockout such as allowing all ops to join, allowing any whitelisted player to join and allowing all players that have joined before to join.
